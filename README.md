# Reading list for SAS Programmer
A list of books for SAS learners. Most of the items could be googled and returned on the first google search page.
## Warm up
Don't konw where to start? You can jump into these two books. These are for the SAS certification but it covers most of the techinques used during industrial SAS programming environment.

Reading and do all the exercises twice. Just reading without coding is equal to nothing. 
1. SAS Certification Prep Guide: Base Programming for SAS 9
2. SAS Certification Prep Guide: Advanced Programming for SAS 9

After going the two books, you are most likely the top SAS coders now and these concepts should come off top of your head
- PDV
- Array
- Loop
- Macro

## Database
Though not directly related, knowledge about relational algebra and sql database would help a lot. I recommend the following
1. Database course by Jennifer Widom from Stanford Online classes. 
2. SAS(R) 9.3 SQL Procedure User's Guide from SAS (This is one the few manuals I recommend read from head to tail and it's not long).

## Macro
The macro makes SAS more powerful than others and this is my favoriate
1. Carpenter's Complete Guide to the SASÂ® Macro Language

## Report
The report proc step is the standard way to create reproducible report. By report, in industry and tables occur much more frequently than figures. Utlizing proc report will eliminate ctnl+c and ctnl+v and save time if data are updating.
1. Carpenter's complete guide to the SAS REPORT procedure

## SAS Manual
Of course, referring to SAS manual all the time.

## Algorithm (optional)
This is more general idea about programming and learning algorithm is dangerous. It will turn you into a computer-minded and force you to think like a computer. When you get bored, try this.
1. Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick from Coursera.
