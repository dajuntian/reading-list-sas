# Reading list for SAS Programmer
A list of books for SAS learners
## Warm up
Don't konw where to start? You can jump into these two books. These are for the SAS certification but it covers most of the techinques used during industrial SAS programming environment.

Reading and do all the exercises twice. Just reading without coding is equal to nothing. 
1. SAS Certification Prep Guide: Base Programming for SAS 9
2. SAS Certification Prep Guide: Advanced Programming for SAS 9

After going the two books, you are most likely the top SAS coders now and these concepts should come off top of your head
- PDV
- Array
- Loop
- Macro

## Database
Though not directly related, knowledge about relational algebra and sql database would help a lot. I recommend the following
1. Database course tought by Jennifer Widom from Stanford Online classes. 
2. SAS(R) 9.3 SQL Procedure User's Guide from SAS (This is one the few manuals from SAS I recommend read from head to tail and it's not long).
